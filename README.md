Feature Breakdown:

User Management
Allows users to register, log in, and manage their profiles. The system supports different roles (e.g., guest and host), each with specific permissions and access levels.

Property Management
Hosts can list properties with details such as title, description, photos, location, and pricing. They can also update or delete their listings at any time.

Booking System
Guests can search for properties, view availability, and book stays. The system ensures that booking dates do not overlap and that properties are reserved in real time.

Review & Rating
After a stay, guests can leave reviews and ratings for properties. This helps future users make informed decisions and encourages quality hosting.

Payment Integration
Secure payment processing for bookings. Supports tracking of payment status, methods, and transaction history.

Search & Filtering
Users can search properties by location, availability, price range, and other filters. This improves the user experience by helping them find suitable options quickly.



API Security:

To protect sensitive data and ensure safe interactions within the Airbnb Clone project, the following security measures will be implemented:

Authentication
Users must log in using secure credentials (e.g., JWT-based authentication). This ensures only verified users can access protected routes, helping protect personal data and prevent identity misuse.

Authorization
Role-based access control restricts what actions users can perform (e.g., only hosts can manage properties). This prevents unauthorized access to sensitive operations like modifying listings or viewing other users’ bookings.

Rate Limiting
Limits the number of API requests from a single IP over time. This prevents abuse, brute-force attacks, and helps maintain the stability of the service.

Data Validation & Sanitization
All incoming data is validated and cleaned to prevent SQL injection, XSS, and other injection attacks. This protects both users and the backend systems from malicious input.

HTTPS Enforcement
All communication with the API will be encrypted using HTTPS to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks and secure the transmission of sensitive data like login credentials and payment information.



CI/CD Pipeline:

CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment) is a development practice that automates the process of testing, building, and deploying code. It helps ensure that every change made to the codebase is automatically verified and safely delivered to production.

Implementing a CI/CD pipeline improves code quality, reduces bugs, and accelerates development by catching issues early and enabling fast, reliable releases.

Tools Used:

GitHub Actions: Automates testing, linting, and deployment workflows directly from the repository.

Docker: Ensures consistency by packaging the app and its dependencies into portable containers.

Docker Hub / GitHub Container Registry: Stores and manages container images for deployment.

Cloud Hosting Services (e.g., Heroku, AWS, Render): Automatically deploy updated builds.
